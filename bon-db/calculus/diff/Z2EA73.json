    "\\begin{soln}\n  For the sake of contradiction, assume such a\n  function exists. Note that as $f(x)$ is differentiable,\n  $f(f(x))$ is also differentiable and so is $f'(x)=f(f(x))$.\n\n  Note that $f'(x) = f(f(x)) > 0$ implies\n  $f$ is strictly increasing.\n  This along with $f > 0$ implies that\n  $\\lim_{x \\to -\\oo} f(x)$ exists.\n  (Details are left to the reader.)\n\n  Let $\\ell = \\lim_{x \\to -\\oo} f(x)$. By LMVT, there exists\n  $c_x \\in (x, x+1)$ such that\n  \\[\n    f'(c_x) = \\frac{f(x+1) - f(x)}{(x+1) - x} = f(x+1) - f(x)\n    \\qquad \\forall\\, x \\in \\RR\n  .\\]\n  Then note $\\lim_{x \\to -\\oo} c_x = -\\oo$. So,\n  \\[\n    \\lim_{x \\to -\\oo} f'(c_x) = \\ell - \\ell = 0\n  .\\]\n\n  Differentiating our original equation, we get\n  \\[\n    f''(x) = f'(f(x)) \\cdot f'(x) > 0\n  .\\]\n  Therefore $f'(x)$ is also strictly increasing. Recall that\n  we derived $f'(x)> 0$\n  for all $x\\in \\RR$. So, by an analogous logic,\n  $\\lim_{x \\to -\\oo} f'(x)$ also exists. Thus\n  \\[\n    \\lim_{x \\to -\\oo} f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\oo} f'(c_x) = 0\n  .\\]\n  Plugging this back into our original equation, we get\n  \\[\n    0 = \\lim_{x \\to -\\oo} f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\oo} f(f(x))\n    = f(\\lim_{x \\to -\\oo} f(x)) = f(\\ell)\n  \\] \n  which contradicts the fact that $f(x) > 0$ for all\n  $x \\in \\RR$.\n\n  Thus our initial claim must have been false and we are done.\n\\end{soln}"
