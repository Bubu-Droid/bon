    "\\begin{soln}\n  Clearly $g(x)$ is differentiable on $(0,\\oo)$.\n  Note that\n  \\[\n    g'(x) = \\frac{f'(x)x - f(x)}{x^2}\n  .\\]\n  It suffices to show that $g'(x) \\ge 0$ which is equivalent\n  to showing $f'(x) \\ge \\frac{f(x)}{x}$. But note that by LMVT,\n  \\[\n    \\frac{f(x)}{x}=\\frac{f(x)-f(0)}{x-0}=f'(c_x) \\le f'(x)\n  \\]\n  where $c_x \\in (0,x)$ and the last inequality follows by\n  monotonicity of $f'$.

    "\\begin{soln}\n  Fix $0<x<y$ arbitrarily. By LMVT on $(0,x)$, we get\n  \\[\n    \\frac{f(x)-f(0)}{x-0}=f'(c_x)\n  \\]\n  for some $c_x \\in (0,x)$.

    "\\begin{soln}\n  From the condition that $f'$ is monotonically increasing,\n  it is straightforward to prove that $f$ is convex.
