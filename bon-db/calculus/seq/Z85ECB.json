    "\\begin{soln}\n  Plugging $x=0$ and $x=1$, we get $f(-f(0)) = 0$ and\n  $f(2-f(1))=1$ respectively. Since the co-domain of\n  $f$ is $[0,1]$, the following inequalities follow:\n  $0 \\le -f(0) \\le 1$ and $0\\le 2-f(1) \\le 1$.\n  Now note that as both $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ lie in\n  $[0,1]$, one-sided equality in the previous inequalities\n  is forced which implies $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$.\n  Therefore, as $f$ is continuous, it must be surjective.\n  Along with the injectivity, we can conclude that $f$\n  is bijective.\n\n  Fix $x_1 \\in [0, 1]$ arbitrarily and define a\n  recursive sequence\n  $\\left\\{ x_{n} \\right\\}_{n \\ge 1}$ as follows:\n  \\[\n    x_{n+1} = f(x_n) \\quad \\forall\\, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\n  \\]\n  which makes sense as the range of $f$ is a subset of $[0,1]$.\n\n  Then from our original equation, we get\n  \\[\n    f(2x - f(x)) = x \\implies f(x) = 2x - f^{-1}(x).\n  \\]\n  Substituting $x \\mapsto x_{n+1}$, we get\n  \\[\n    f(x_{n+1}) = 2x_{n+1} - f^{-1}(x_{n+1})\n  \\]\n  which is equivalent to\n  \\[\n    x_{n+2}=2x_{n+1}-x_{n}\n  .\\]\n  Note that\n  \\[\n    x_{n+2}-x_{n+1}=x_{n+1}-x_{n}=\\dots=x_2-x_1\n  \\]\n  which implies $\\left\\{ x_{n} \\right\\}_{n\\ge 1}$ is an\n  A.P. If $d=x_2-x_1\\neq 0$, then $x_{n}=x_1+(n-1)d$ diverges\n  as $n \\to \\infty$. But the sequence is supposed\n  to be bounded as $f(x_n)$ is itself bounded.\n  This implies $x_2 = x_1$,\n  which further implies $f(x_1) = x_1$.\n  Since $x_1$ was chosen arbitrarily, we conclude\n  that $f(x) = x$ for all $x \\in [0, 1]$.\n\\end{soln}"
