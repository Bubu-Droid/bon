    "\\begin{soln}\n  Define a function\n  $f\\colon \\mathcal{P}([n])\\to \\mathcal{P}([n])$ by\n  \\[\n  f(A)=\\{n+1-a\\mid a\\in A\\}.\n  \\]\n\n  Call the sets satisfying the property to be good.\n  Note that $f(f(A))=A$. Now it is easy to see that\n  $A$ is good if and only if $f(A)$ is good.\n\n  Now we make cases based on the parity of $n$.\n\n  \\begin{enumerate}[(i)]\n    \\ii \\textbf{$n$ is even:}\n      We need to show that $T_n$ is even.\n\n      If $A \\neq f(A)$, we can pair them up.\n      We focus on the case when $f(A)=A$.\n      If $|A|$ is odd, then there must exist an element\n      $a\\in A$ such that $a=n+1-a$, i.e., $a=\\frac{n+1}{2}$,\n      which is impossible as $n$ is even.\n\n      So, $|A|$ must be even. Let $|A|=2k$.\n      Then the sum of all the elements of $A$ is $(n+1)k$.\n      So, the average is\n      \\[\n      \\frac{(n+1)k}{2k}=\\frac{n+1}{2},\n      \\]\n      which is not an integer.\n\n      Thus the condition $f(A)=A$ is not possible.\n      Therefore $T_n$ is even as we can\n      pair up $A$ and $f(A)$, as desired.\n\n    \\ii \\textbf{$n$ is odd:} It suffices to show that\n      $T_n$ is odd.\n\n      If $A\\ne f(A)$, we can pair them up\n      just like in the previous case.\n      We focus on the case when $f(A)=A$.\n\n      If $|A|$ is even, note that\n      \\[\n        a\\in A\\iff n+1-a\\in A.\n      \\]\n      As\n      \\[\n      \\frac{n+1}{2}=n+1 - \\frac{n+1}{2},\n      \\]\n      $\\frac{n+1}{2}\\notin A$ in this case.\n      So, if we create pairs in the fashion\n      $(1,n)$, $(2,n-1)$, etc.,\n      then the presence of any one element in a pair implies\n      the presence of the other.\n\n      Suppose $k$ of these pairs are present in $A$.\n      Then the sum of the elements is\n      \\[\n      \\frac{(n+1)k}{2},\n      \\]\n      which is an integer.\n      Therefore, any $A$ constructed from these pairs works.\n\n      Here we have $2^{\\frac{n-1}{2}}-1$ ways of choosing\n      which pairs to include.\n\n      If $|A|$ is odd, it is easy to see $\\frac{n+1}{2}\\in A$.\n      Consider the pairs just as in the previous case.\n      Suppose $k$ of these pairs contribute to $A$.\n      Then the sum of elements of $A$ is\n      \\[\n      \\frac{(n+1)k}{2}+\\frac{n+1}{2}\n      =\\frac{(n+1)(k+1)}{2},\n      \\]\n      which is an integer.\n\n      So, there are $2^{\\frac{n-1}{2}}$ ways to\n      choose the set $A$.\n\n      Thus, in total, there are $2^{\\frac{n-1}{2}+1}-1$\n      possible values of $A$ which implies\n      $T_n$ is odd, as desired.\n  \\end{enumerate}\n\\end{soln}"
