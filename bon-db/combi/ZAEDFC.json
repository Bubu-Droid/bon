    "\\begin{soln}\n  Let $S_i$ denote the set of all the tuples $(a,b)$ such\n  that $f(a,b) = i$. Now note that for each\n  $a \\in {1, 2, \\ldots, n}$, there is exactly one $k$ such\n  that $f(a,k) = i$. Thus the set $S_i$ has at\n  exactly $n$ elements.\n\n  Now note that if $(a,b)$ is in $S_i$, $(b,a)$ is also\n  in $S_i$. Now if $a \\not= b$, then we get\n  a pair of two tuples\n  that are present in $S_i$. But the cardinality of $S_i$\n  is odd. Thus there must be some $m$ such that $(m,m)$\n  is also in $S_i$.\n\n  Denote this tuple as $(m_i, m_i)$ for each $S_i$.\n  Now note that a tuple $(m_i, m_i)$ cannot be present\n  in two sets. This is because otherwise, $f(m_i, m_i) = i$\n  and $f(m_i, m_i) = j$ which implies $i=j$, contradiction.\n  \n  So each $S_i$ has at least one $(m_i, m_i)$ such that\n  this $(m_i, m_i)$ tuple is not present in any other $S_j$.\n\n  Now note that we have exactly $n$ many $(m_i,m_i)$ \n  tuples and there is at least one\n  distinct $(m_i,m_i)$ present\n  in each of the $n$ sets of $S_i$. Thus the equality\n  holds and there is exactly one $(m_i, m_i)$ in each $S_i$.\n\n\n  Thus we have that there is exactly one tuple $(m_i, m_i)$\n  in each $S_i$ and we are done, because this forces\n  $f(r,r) \\not= f(s,s)$.\n\\end{soln}"
