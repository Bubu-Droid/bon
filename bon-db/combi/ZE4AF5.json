    "\\begin{soln}\n  Number the rows and columns from $1$ to $8$ from left to right\n  top to bottom respectively.\n\n  Let $a_{i,j}$ denote the cell of ith row and jth\n  column.\n\n  Note that $a_{i,j}=8(i-1)+j$. Now,\n  \\[\n  a_{i,j}+a_{m,n}=a_{m,j}+a_{i,n}=a_{i,n}+a_{j,m}\n  .\\]\n  \n  So we can swap the indices of the rows and columns when the\n  two $a_{i,j}$ are in sum.\n\n  Let $\\left\\{ a_{i_{1},j_1},a_{i_2,j_2},\\dots,\n  a_{i_8,j_8} \\right\\}$ \n  be the chosen cells.\n\n  Therefore, $\\left\\{ i_1,i_2,\\dots,i_8 \\right\\}$ and\n  $\\left\\{ j_1,j_2,\\dots,j_8 \\right\\}$ are a\n  permutation of $\\left\\{ 1,2,\\dots,8 \\right\\}$ since one cell\n  is chosen from each row and column.\n\n  We can permute the $\\left\\{ i_1,i_2,\\dots,i_8 \\right\\}$ in\n  a pairwise manner such that they change to $1$, $2$, \\dots, 8\n in order and the sum of $\\sum_{k=1}^n a_{i_k,j_k}$\n  remains the same. Similarly we can permute the indices of the\n  columns too.\n\n  Therefore,\n  \\[\n      \\sum_{n=1}^{8} a_{i_n,j_n}=\\sum_{n=1}^{8} a_{n,n}\n    = \\sum_{n=1}^{8} 8(k-1)+k\n    = 260\n  .\\qedhere\\]\n\\end{soln}"
