    "\\begin{soln}\n  We use arrows to solve this problem. Draw a graph with the\n  $x_i$ as the vertices and draw a directed edge\n  from $x_i\\to x_{\\sigma(i)}$. It is well known that this\n  graph can be decomposed into disjoint cycles (including\n  $1$-cycles).\n\n  \\begin{claim*}\n    Let $M=\\max\\left\\{ x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_{2025} \\right\\}$. Then\n    all the elements in a cycle containing $M$ must be equal\n    to $M$.\n  \\end{claim*}\n  \\begin{subproof}\n    FTSOC assume not. This means that there is another element\n    $x_{i}$ in the same cycle as that of $M$ such that\n    $x_{i}<M$.\n\n    Firstly note that $2x_{\\sigma(i)}=x_{i}+x_{i+1}\n    <M+x_{i+1}\\le 2M\\implies x_{\\sigma(i)}<M$. Similarly,\n    $x_{\\sigma(i)}<M\\implies x_{\\sigma(\\sigma(i))}<M$.\n    We can continue this pattern till we get back to the\n    element with value $M$ which implies $M<M$\n    giving our desired contradiction.\n  \\end{subproof}\n  \n  Now pick a cycle containing $M$. Therefore all the elements\n  in this cycle are equal to $M$.\n\n  Let the elements of this cycle be denoted as\n  $\\left\\{ x_{i_1},x_{i_2},\\ldots,x_{i_k} \\right\\}$. Here\n  $\\sigma(i_1)=i_2$, $\\sigma(i_2)=i_3$ and so on up to\n  $\\sigma(i_k)=i_1$.\n\n  Now, $x_{i_1-1}+x_{i_1}=2x_{i_2}\\implies x_{i_1-1}=M$.\n  Similarly, we can also derive that\n  $x_{i_2-1}=x_{i_3-1}=\\cdots=x_{i_k-1}=M$.\n\n  Note that from the indices $\\left\\{ i_1,i_2,\\ldots,i_k\n  \\right\\}$, we just traversed to $\\left\\{ i_1-1,\n  i_2-1,\\ldots,i_k-1\\right\\}$. We can continue doing so\n  till we cover all the indices modulo $2025$.\n\n  This shows that all the elements $x_i=M$ and we are done.\n\\end{soln}"
