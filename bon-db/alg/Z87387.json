    "\\begin{soln}\n    We divide the solution into two cases based on the parity\n    of $n$.\n\n  \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{If $n$ is even:} Then $4\\mid n^{4}$ and\n      $4\\mid 4^{n}$ which implies $4\\mid n^{4}+4^{n}$ which\n      makes it composite.\n    \\item \\textbf{If $n$ is odd:} Then let $n=2k+1$ where\n      $k\\ge 1$ as $n\\ge 3$.\n\n      Then $n^{4}+4^{n}=n^{4}+4\\cdot 2^{4k}$. Let $2^{k}=m$.\n      \\[\n        n^{4}+4^{n}=n^{4}+4\\cdot m^{4}=(n^{2}+2m^2-2nm)\n        (n^2+2m^2+2nm)\n      .\\]\n      \n      To finish, note that,\n      \\[\n        n^2+2m^2+2mn>n^2+2m^2-2mn=(n-m)^2+m^2\\ge 4\n      .\\]\n      Thus both the two numbers are $\\ge 4$ which means that\n      their product is composite.\n  \\end{itemize}\n\\end{soln}"
