    "\\begin{soln}\n  We use a lemma which absolutely obliterates this problem.\n  \\begin{lemma*}{}{}\n    Let $P(x)$, $Q(x)\\in\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ be two monic\n    non-constant polynomials and $R(x)\\in\\mathbb{R}[x]$\n    be another\n    polynomial such that it satisfies,\n    \\[\n      P(x) = Q(x)\\cdot R(x)\n    .\\]\n  Then $R(x)\\in\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ and is monic.\n  \\end{lemma*}\n  \\begin{subproof}\n    Let $\\deg(R) = n$. Pick any $n+1$ points where\n    $Q(x)$ is non-zero. Therefore, for these points,\n    $R(x) = P(x)/Q(x)$ is rational. By Lagrange\n    Interpolation, we can conclude that $R(x)$ has rational\n    coefficients.\n\n    Now we show that the coefficients must all be integers.\n\n    Let $R(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\dots+a_0x^{0}$ where\n    $a_{i}$ are rational numbers $\\frac{p_i}{q_i}$ for\n    integers $p_i$, $q_i$ with $\\gcd(p_i, q_i) = 1$.\n\n    Let\n    $L = \\operatorname{lcm}(q_1,q_2,\\dots,q_n)$.\n    If $L=1$, we are done.\n\n    Suppose not. Then there exists a prime $u$ such that\n    $u\\mid L$. We multiply both sides by $L$. This helps\n    us clearing out the denominator of $R(x)$.\n\n    Clearly the polynomial $L\\cdot P(x)$ is divisible by $u$.\n    So by working in $\\mathbb{F}_u$ we can deduce\n    that $L\\cdot P(x)\\equiv 0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_u$.\n    Now as $L\\cdot P(x) = Q(x)\\cdot(L\\cdot R(x))$,\n    we must have $Q(x)\\equiv 0$ or $L\\cdot R(x)\\equiv 0$\n    in $\\mathbb{F}_u$. But clearly $Q(x)\\not\\equiv 0$\n    as it is monic.\n    Thus $L\\cdot R(x)\\equiv 0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_u$.\n\n\n    This means that\n    $u\\mid p_i\\cdot \\frac{L}{q_i}$ for all $i$.\n\n    Now pick $q_m$ such that $\\nu_{u}(q_m)=\\nu_{u}(L)$.\n    Clearly $\\nu_{u}(q_m)\\ge 1$.\n\n    Therefore $\\nu_{u}\\left(\\frac{L}{q_m}\\right)=0$.\n    Also, as $\\gcd(p_m, q_m) = 1$, so $\\gcd(p_m, u) = 1$.\n    This means that\n    $\\gcd\\left(p_m\\cdot \\frac{L}{q_m}, u\\right) = 1$\n    which contradicts the fact that\n    $u\\mid p_i \\cdot \\frac{L}{q_{i}}$ for all $i$.\n  \\end{subproof}\n\n  Now lets use this bazooka to kill our fly.\n  \n  Note that $Q_2(x) = x^2-1$. Therefore by using induction\n  on $n$ with the base case starting from $n=1$, we can\n  say that $Q_{n}(x)\\cdot Q_{n-2}(x) = Q_{n-1}(x)^2-1$\n  along with the fact that $Q_{n-2}(x)$ and\n  $Q_{n-1}(x)^2-1$ are monic integer polynomials\n  implies that $Q_{n}(x)$ is a\n  monic integer polynomial.\n\\end{soln}"
